Current task: Domain Modeling
- acceptance test that ties together the work of movement and fight
- alienArrives does not leave the winning Alien in the City so that he can start moving again at the next turn
- alienArrives must deal with the case where the city was empty before. We may need another Event, AlienConflict?
-- or the change in state of City::$alien must be made in City::alienArrives(), changing the transactional boundaries this way:
--- MoveAlien Command -> AlienLeftCity, AlienReachedCity Events
--- AlienReachedCity Event -> AlienArrives Command -> AliensFightStarted, AlienWonFight Events

Features
- Aliens move at random between connected cities
- Aliens win at random
